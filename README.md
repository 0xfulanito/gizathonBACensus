## ✨ Open Enrollment Market Forecast

What problem are you trying to solve?
The open enrollment process in the US health insurance business presents significant challenges for agents.  One of the main issues is lack of in-advance information about the trendies and expected changes in the market during the following period of registration.  Insurance Agents need to rely on precise and fast indicators in order to take well-informed and strategic decisions for the open enrollment process.

What is your solution to this problem? Our proposed solution is to provide one analytic service that utilizes prediction models offering indicators of the Open Enrollment market in advance and in a precise way.  This service would allow insurance agents to access valuable information related to trendies and expected behavior from consumers, helping them as well to being able to anticipate and adapt themselves proactively to the conditions in the market.
