## ✨ Census Verifiable

The Open Enrollment Period (OEP) is a period that occurs once a year in the USA, during which individuals can enroll in health insurance, adjust their plan, or cancel it.
In the field of the USA health insurance industry, it is important for insurance agents to have an accurate estimate of the expected number of consumers for the next
Open Enrollment period, as this would help them gauge the exposed market and thus establish effective strategic planning.
This is why the idea of creating a linear regression model to forecast expected consumers by county arises, using data from the population estimation conducted
by the US Census Bureau and data from the previous OEP Market period, to predict the number of individuals who are likely to seek enrollment in health insurance
plans in a specific geographical region during the next open enrollment period, and thus insurance agents have information that allows them to establish better
resource planning, customization of marketing strategies, optimize coverage, and thus enhance informed decision-making.
